Complexity of sorting algs:

Bubble sort/ selection sort:    n-1 + n-2 + n-3 + n-4  ~ n^2/2 (selection sort has fewer swaps)

Insertion: worst -> n^2/2  avg -> n^2/4

Divide, conquer, and glue algorithms: (code in SortArrays.java)

    Merge sort:
        1. Divide list in 2 halves
        2. Sort each half recursively (using merge sort)
        3. Merge two sorted halves



    Quick Sort:
        1. Partitions list into smaller and larger portions
        2. Recursively sort each portion

        Partitioning:
        - pick a pivot element, e.g. first --> p = a[0]
        - elements less than p go on the left, everything larger goes on the right
