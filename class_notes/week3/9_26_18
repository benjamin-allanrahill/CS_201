VECTORS:

- a vector is an extendable array

What if we just grew the vector by 1?

T(n) = n(n+1)/2  --> would make it really slow

What if we grow it by doubling?

  Only done 2n work and is O(n) --> linear time

  Interfaces:

  public interface Circular{

  }

  Chapter 1.8


  Sorting Algorithms:

  bubbleSort:

    compares the first one to the second one
    largest one will "bubble" to the top
    keep making passes until the array is sorted

    Ex:

    Sorting.java


Selection Sort:
    - Search the array for the biggest #
    - swap that with the last value
    - keep track of the index

Insertion sort:
    - Start with the first element and keep making a sorted portion
