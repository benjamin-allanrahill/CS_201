Can we sort n #s in linear time?

Spaghetti Sort:
    - Cut spaghetti to size O(n)
    - Sort using "gravity"      O(1)
    - Repeat: pick largest, measure, output #   O(n)

    Limitation:
    - Limited range
    - Limited precision


Counting sort:
    - have N integers to sort with limited range
    - compute histogram
    - print scores per # of count

Bucket sort:
    - have N floats in range 0.0 --- M & B buckets
    - use B= N/10

    ex: N = 1000 B = 100  M = 200.0

    - Sort each bucket (quick, Insertion, etc.)
    - only works well if #s are uniformly distributed

Radix sort:
    - sort N ints w/ K digits
    - make K passes
        - sort #s into K buckets by digit (least significant digit first )
    O(k * N)
