Heaps:

Complete tree -- full, except for last level, which is filled from left

    - can store values in array in level order

    node i --   left child:   2i +1
                right child:  2i +2


get() --> O(1)


add(E val) -- >

      - add x as next leaf in level order
      - percolateUp

      runtime -> O(H) (height) ==> O(log(n))


      N ~ 2^H
      H is O(log(n))


remove():

    - remove last leaf, put at root
    - pushDownRoot

    runtime - O(log(n))



Heap Sort:

- add N values and remove N vals


Skew heaps:

      - merge(A, B)


      assume first heap has smaller value

      swap children of first heap and merge recursively
