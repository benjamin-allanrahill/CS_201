// Class notes for 11/14/18


Take home midterm:

splits based off x and then next level is off y

rebuild builds balanced tree
    - traverses (pre-order) tree and stores value
    - take median x coord for new root
    - recursively does the same thing on the left and right
        - alternating between x and y
